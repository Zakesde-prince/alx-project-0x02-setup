# Next.js Project Setup and Basics

This repository is for my ALX Frontend project: **SoloForge: Mastering Project Autonomy**.

The goal is to learn how to create a modern web application using **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**. I will build reusable components, connect to external APIs, and follow best practices to structure my codebase properly.
